##DNA-Seq
![Menu][2]

This program, developed with [OpenCV library][1], automates the sequencing of the DNA.

Gets an image ([like that one][3]) of a table with the DNA sequence as an input, and generates a file with the result. Also detects the mutations and the [intron][4].

###WARNING
This project was developed as an exercise at University in Computer Vision subject.

It's written in a very bad way because it's were developed a few years ago, when mi codding skills and Knowledge were in it's very beginning.

**There is no logger support for this repo!**

###Usage
* Just install [OpenCV libraries][1] and clone the repo.
* Execute the [compiles.sh][5].
* Put the image with the DNA sequence in the same folder as the program.
* rename it to "image.png".
* Run the program.
